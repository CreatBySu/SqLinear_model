## Contributions

**High-Quality Partitioning.** We propose a novel spatial partitioning method that generates balanced, non-overlapping, and geometrically-regular patches without padding requirements, establishing an optimal foundation for large-scale traffic prediction.

**Hierarchical Linear Modling.** We develop a hierarchical linear interaction module that efficiently captures both inter-patch and intra-patch spatio-temporal interactions, reducing the quadratic complexity bottleneck of attention-based approaches to linear complexity while maintaining modeling fidelity.    

**Theoretical Analysis.** We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for our partitioning method, proving its effectiveness in preserving network topology and ensuring efficiency.

**Extensive Experiments.** An experimental study on 4 large-scale datasets shows that SqLinear achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy while reducing parameter counts by $2\times$ and accelerating training by $3\times$ compared to existing baselines, validating its practical utility for city-scale deployment.

## Quick Demos
1. Download datasets and place them under `./data`
2. We provide pre-trained weights of results in the paper and the detail configurations under the folder `./config`. For example, you can test the SD dataset by:

```
python main.py --config ./config/SD.conf
```

3. If you want to train the model yourself, you can use the code at line 288 of the main file.
